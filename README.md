**A HTML CSS JS Project**. Made as a practice project. The idea was taken from web development community <br>

There will be 5 pages in the website (HomePage, MenuPage, AboutPage, ContactPage, BookingPage). In this project I learned how we can create a website using simple `HTML, CSS`. The main purpose of the project is to get more used to with HTML, CSS. Although I used a few lines of JavaScript in the project for necessary cases. Later on, in this project, I also learned how we can deploy this site using `Netlify`. Also, I learned the process from the zero to end and make the website ready for live production.

## What I learned:

- HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Scroll Animation
- Netlify Deployment
- Netlify Form functionality
- And more . . .
